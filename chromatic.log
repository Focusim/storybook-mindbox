Retrieving git information
✖ Found only one commit
This typically means you have ran into one of the following scenarios:
- You've checked out a shallow copy of the Git repository, which some CI systems do by default.
  In order for Chromatic to correctly determine baseline commits, we need access to the full Git history graph.
  Refer to your CI provider's documentation for details.
- You've only made a single commit so far.  
  Please make at least one additional commit in order for Chromatic to be able to detect what's changed.

Your project is linked to GitHub so Chromatic will report results there.
This means you can pass the --exit-once-uploaded flag to skip waiting for build results.
